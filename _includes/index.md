# Hi, I'm Charlie

I'm a professional software developer working in multiple languages on multiple projects. 

I'm interested in __programming__, __API integration__, __Linux__ and __SaaS products__. Among other things, I; design, develop and launch business solutions and products.

# Technical Interests

I'm a full-stack software developer with a variety of skills. 

I've implemented RESTful APIs for companies with a 60,000+ user base, developed on both front-end and back-end infrastructure, created Android applications as well as launched multiple businesses. 

I'm an advocate for FOSS, you can find (most) of my contributions to the community on my [GitHub](https://github.com/cdrage). My favourite OS is [Debian](https://debian.org).

My current endeavours are managing and growing [Soshipop](https://soshipop.com) an Instagram growth tool and [DataMantle](https://datamantle.com) a Linux cloud provider.
