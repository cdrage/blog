# Hey, I'm Charlie

I'm an Enterprise Cloud Architect specializing in __Linux__, __Docker__, __Kubernetes__, __SaaS__, __PaaS__ and __IaaS__ consulting.

I've worked with __Docker__ since it's early days and I actively contribute to [multiple](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose/commits?author=cdrage) [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commits?author=cdrage) [related](https://github.com/kedgeproject/kedge/commits?author=cdrage) projects, including [Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby/commits?author=cdrage) [projects](https://github.com/docker/cli/commits?author=cdrage).

I work at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com). I've also worked at tech-related companies such as [Fibernetics Ventures](http://www.fibernetics.ca/about-us/fibernetics-ventures/) and researched software at [UOIT](https://uoit.ca/).

My consulting services are based out of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada but I do remote freelance work for clients elsewhere. Visit my [contact](/contact) information to get a hold of me.
