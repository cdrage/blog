# Hi, I'm Charlie

I'm a professional software developer working in multiple languages on multiple projects. 

I'm interested in __programming__, __API integration__, __Linux__ and __SaaS products__. Among other things, I; design, develop and launch business solutions and products.

# Technical Interests

I'm a full-stack software developer that specializes in virtual machines as well as containers. My tools of the trade are __Ruby__ and __Python__ for anything script related. __Go__, __Rust__ (as of recently) and __Java__ (sometimes) for compiled binaries / production.

Anything to do with containers, I've contributed and worked with it. That includes: __Docker__, __rkt__ and __Kubernetes__. I use __CoreOS__ in production as well as dabble with other container-based operating systems such as __Project Atomic__. I am part of both the [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes) and [Project Atomic](github.com/projectatomic) organizations. I have a large list of [Docker](https://github.com/cdrage/dockerfiles) and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/cdrage/composefiles) files I actively contribute and maintain.

I've also worked extensively on virtual machines as well as the "cloud". Utilizing __KVM__ as well as __libvirt__ during most of my time. I implemented a public RESTful API for a cloud company with a 60,000+ VM base, created a business named [DataMantle](https://datamantle.com) for cloud hosting as well as deployed and maintained more virtual machines than I can remember.

I'm an advocate for FOSS, you can find (most) of my contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdrage).

My current endeavours are freelancing, contributing to open source, [Soshipop](https://soshipop.com) an Instagram growth tool and [DataMantle](https://datamantle.com) a Linux cloud provider.
