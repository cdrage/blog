# Hi, I'm Charlie

I'm a professional software developer working in multiple languages on multiple projects. 

I'm interested in __programming__, __API integration__, __Linux__ and __SaaS products__. Among other things, I; design, develop and launch business solutions and products.

# Technical Interests

I'm a full-stack software developer that specializes in virtual machines as well as containers. My tools of the trade are __Ruby__ and __Python__ for anything script related. __Go__, __Rust__ (as of recently) and __Java__ (sometimes) for compiled binaries / production.

Anything to do with containers, I've both contributed and worked with it. That includes: __Docker__, __rkt__,  __Kubernetes__, CoreOS and Project Atomic. I am part of both the [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes) and [Project Atomic](github.com/projectatomic) organizations.

I've also worked extensively on virtual machines as well as the "cloud". Utilizing __KVM__ as well as __libvirt__ during most of my time. I implemented a public RESTful API for a cloud company with over 60,000+ virtual machines, created multiple hosting companies with custom written software as well as deployed and maintained thousands of virtual machines.

I'm an advocate for FOSS, you can find (most) of my contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdrage).
