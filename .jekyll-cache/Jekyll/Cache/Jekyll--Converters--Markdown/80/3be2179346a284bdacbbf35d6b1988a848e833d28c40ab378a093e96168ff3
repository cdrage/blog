I"Š<p>I recently switched to a $20 / month 1GB data-only plan for my phone. Gone are the days of $70+ bills. Data only. No built-in SMS / phoning. Only awesome data.</p>

<p>Ironically, if you ask anywhere if they have a data-only plan for cell-phones, they would reply no.. However, no one is going to stop you from subscribing to a tablet data-only plan and sticking the SIM card in your phone.</p>

<p>Canadians still pay the highest (in the WORLD!) for cellphones <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cellphone-deals-canada-1.3587744">according to CBC</a>. Seriously. The cheapest plan that you can find is $45 / month for 500MiB of data on <a href="https://koodomobile.com">Koodo</a>. I researched on how I could switch and found <a href="http://http://misener.org/ditched-voice-plan-went-data/">this blog post</a> and decided why-not. The next day, I cancelled my Koodo plan and switch to a Bell data-only tablet plan.</p>

<p>Nothingâ€™s ever 100%. I switched with some caveats introduced with a data-only plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I phone via a SIP provider <a href="http://voip.ms">(VOIP.ms)</a> on a SIP client <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoiper.android.app&amp;hl=en">(Zoiper)</a></li>
  <li>I SMS via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kourlas.voipms_sms&amp;hl=en">VOIP.ms SMS</a> an <a href="https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client">open source</a> Android app that connects to VOIP.msâ€™ free SMS service</li>
  <li>My SIM-card assigned phone number works, but has extremely-high rates (50c a minute, 75c per text). Ideally youâ€™d only use this for emergencies if youâ€™re without data!</li>
</ul>

<p>I wonâ€™t go into detail on how to set this up, but hereâ€™s the gist of what you need to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get rid of that pesky old plan</li>
  <li>Walk into Bell and ask for a tablet data-only flex plan</li>
  <li>Throw that old SIM card out and put in your new one</li>
  <li>Setup a DID on <a href="http://voip.ms">VOIP.ms</a> via <a href="https://www.loganmarchione.com/2014/06/part-1-setting-voip-number-voip-ms/">Step 1</a> and <a href="https://www.loganmarchione.com/2014/08/part-2-setting-voip-number-voip-ms/">Step 2</a> of this <a href="https://www.loganmarchione.com/2014/06/part-1-setting-voip-number-voip-ms/">guide</a>. Afterwards, use a client such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoiper.android.app&amp;hl=en">Zoiper</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple&amp;hl=en">CSipSimple</a> with your DID registration details. This will be your new way to phone people as well as your new number</li>
  <li>Enable SMS on VOIP.ms with <a href="https://wiki.voip.ms/article/SMS">this guide on their wiki</a></li>
  <li>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kourlas.voipms_sms&amp;hl=en">VOIP.ms SMS</a> and enter your login details. Itâ€™s text-only (no MMS or group chats!) but itâ€™s the best way to communicate to those still using non-smartphone plans. Besides, this will be your communication medium to convince them to switch to Hangouts / WhatsApp / Messenger / etc..</li>
</ol>

<p>It only took an hour for setup and a bit of troubleshooting for initially setting up the DID on VOIP.ms (is there ANY service out there with free SMS texting thatâ€™s as clean as VOIP.ms w/ VOIP.ms SMS?)</p>

<p>But now I can relish in the fact that my phone bill is $20 a month (tax-in!) and no longer $65+. Thanks to the flex plan that Bell has, if I decide to go over the 1GB, itâ€™s only $40 / month for 5GB of data. Any GB after that is $10 / month. Reminds me of <a href="https://fi.google.com">Google Fi</a> (plz come to canada!).</p>
