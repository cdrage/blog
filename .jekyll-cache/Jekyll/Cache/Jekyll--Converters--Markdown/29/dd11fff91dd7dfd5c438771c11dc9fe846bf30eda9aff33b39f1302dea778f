I"∂<p>I am a programmer, a tinkering of things. I strive to be as efficient and unobtrusive as possible. From the simplicity and minimalism of interfaces, to the straightforwardness of installations and implementations. I believe in the Unix philosophy of designing small yet capable software. As Doug McIlroy said; ‚ÄúWrite programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.‚Äù. I also believe in the tecnology movement from single high-powered devices to small embedded devices and ‚Äòcloud‚Äô computing.  My favourite programming language is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ruby</code>.</p>
