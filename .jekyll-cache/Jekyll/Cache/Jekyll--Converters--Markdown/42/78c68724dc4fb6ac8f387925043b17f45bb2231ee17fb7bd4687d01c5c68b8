I"N<p>Recently I had to update my Kernel in order to use <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e9be9d5e76e34872f0c37d72e25bc27fe9e2c54c">OverlayFS</a> which was introduced in Kernel 3.18. Unfortunatley Debian 8 is still on 3.16. That, and the fact that Iâ€™ve been wanting to use the newest + latest Kernel improvements.</p>
