I"6<p>I admit it, I drink way too much coffee and spend most of my programming time in a cafe. That’s the life of working remote, changing pace and traveling around all the time.</p>

<p>Here are my favourite places in Waterloo and Kitchener.</p>

<p>Note: Generally, only pictures of coffee (most likely a latte). Go experience the atmosphere yourself!</p>

<h2 id="dvlb-death-valleys-little-brother">DVLB (Death Valley’s Little Brother)</h2>

<p>My favourite place. Beautifully designed, homely and stays open later than any other hipster-ish cafe’s in Waterloo. All caffenated drinks are double-esressos.</p>

<h2 id="seven-shores">Seven Shores</h2>

<p>Feels like a small Toronto cafe. Caffeine kicks in like a mothertrucker.</p>

<h2 id="balzacs-cafe">Balzac’s Cafe</h2>
<p><img src="/img/balzac.jpg" alt="balzac" /></p>

<p>The latte is the size of a freakin’ soup bowl. Located in the same building as Communitech and Google.</p>
